			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>In 2017, Chicago had not collected yard waste from a single household. Wheelie Bin Organics proposal
				offers a new solution, renting a new bin for Chicagoans to place compostable and yard waste materials
				in. We will discuss how this solution will solve Chicago’s yard waste, promote community living and
				change the discussion on compostable materials.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Increase the collection of yard waste percentage from 0% to 50%.</li>
				<li>Creating community awareness for yard waste and organic waste.</li>

			<h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p>Wheelie Bin Organics is a project initiative to revitalize Chicago’s yard waste disposal.
				The way it plans to expand and enact change is by expanding that into diversion of organic materials
				from landfills. The initiative proposes to add on to the existing trash and recycling bin programs.
				People are very familiar with “bin style” garbage collection, as it is widely used throughout this
				nation and the world. The consistency will create make the program understandable and easy to use.
				Citizens will only have to focus on separating the correct items into the correct bins.
				Wheelie Bin Organics will additionally offer purchasable paper bags, for citizens who would not need
				a full bin. Wheelie Bin Organics proposes to offer free yard waste collection during high volume months
				such as October and November.5,6,8 The idea stems from municipalities in Illinois, and throughout
				the world, to encourage yard waste reuse and compost. Lastly, when the organic waste has decomposed
				and gone through the compost process, the Wheelie team would like to sell or donate the dirt to local
				communities and farms to further enhance the community.</p>
			<h3>Significance</h3>
			<p>The Wheelie Bin Organics community wants to promote more environmental awareness in the Chicago community
				by implementing the wheelie bin yard waste and compost initiative that we have outlined above.
				We believe that we can help get the Chicago yard waste collection percentage from 0% to 50% in 10 years.
			</p>
			<h3>Proposed Project Outline</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Develop marketing scheme and initial materials to distribute to citizens.</li>
				<li>Gather initial request for bins and distribute bins.</li>
				<li>Acquire appropriate infrastructure to support collection and space to begin composting.</li>
				<li>Continue to gather Chicago residents to participate and target areas that do not have any one
					participating to promote community engagement. </li>
				<li>After one year, formulate strategies to continue to reach Wheelie Bins goal.</li>

			<h2>Budget</h2>
			<p>By using the current participation rate for the blue carts in the city of approximately 50% and an
				estimated cost of 50 dollars per bin, we came up with the following budgetary numbers. The initial
				start up of the project will run the city 15 million dollars for new carts. At a surcharge of 10 dollars
				per month per household, this city is expected to generate 36 million in revenue from this program.
				The remaining 21 million will then be used to cover the costs of new employees and infrastructure
				support the new pick ups. We strongly urge the city to use any remaining funds from this year and
				subsequent years for promotional events and materials to continue the city to compost and reuse as
				much as possible. We estimate 10 dollars a month is an appropriate figure comparing it to similar
				programs in other cities.
