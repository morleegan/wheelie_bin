			<h1>Wheelie Bin Organics: A Project Initiative to Combat Chicago Yard Waste</h1>
		</div>

		<div id="summary">
			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>In 2017 Chicago had no yard waste collected in a single household. This proposal offers a new solution, renting a new bin for Chicagoans to place compostable and yard waste materials in. We will discuss how this solution will solve Chicago’s yard waste, promote community living and change the discussion on compostable materials.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Solving the yard waste issue </li>
				<li>Promote community living (ie dirt for community garden projects and other ideas)</li>
				<li>Solving food waste issue</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p>Wheelie Bin is a project initiative to revitalize Chicago’s yard waste disposal and also expand that into diversion of organic materials from landfills. The project consists of simply adding on to the existing blue cart program. Consistency will play a key role here, something that Chicago has lacked in its yard waste management in recent years. People are very familiar with “bin style” garbage collection as it is widely used throughout not only this nation but the world. This leaves the citizens to only have to focus on separating the correct items into the correct bins. For those who do not feel they want to participate or have less waste than others, purchasable paper bags will be the alternative to acquiring the bin. We also believe the city should begin to offer free yard waste collection during high volume months such as October and November. This is not only common for municipalities in Illinois, but ones throughout the world.</p>

			<h3>Proposed Project Outline</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Develop marketing scheme and initial materials to distribute to citizens</li>
				<li>Gather initial request for bins / purchase appropriate bins</li>
				<li>Acquire appropriate infrastructure to support </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Budget</h2>
			<p>By using the current participation rate for the blue carts in the city of approximately 50% and an estimated cost of $50 / cart, we came up with the following budgetary numbers. The initial start up of the project will run the city $15 Mil. for new carts. At a surcharge of $10/month per household, this city is expected to generate $36 Mil. in revenue from this program. The remaining $21 Mil. will then be used to cover the costs of new employees and infrastructure support the new pick ups. We strongly urge the city to use any remaining funds from this year and subsequent years for promotional events and materials to continue the city to recycle and reuse as much as possible. We feel the $10/month is an appropriate figure comparing it to similar programs in other cities.</p>
